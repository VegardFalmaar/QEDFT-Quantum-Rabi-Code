A first run to store results regarding the QR model.
        Results are the (Levy--)Lieb-type functional F, the value of v which
        correspond to F, and the optimal translation s of the Gaussian trial
        states.

        Runs are performed with the constrained optimization (i.e. fixing j to
        the optimal value from the hypervirial theorem) using oscillator size
        40.

        Larger values for lambda create trouble for the small values of t,
        therefore the parameters here are in the ranges
        lambda: [0, 2]
        t: [0.2, 3]
        sigma: (-1, 1)
