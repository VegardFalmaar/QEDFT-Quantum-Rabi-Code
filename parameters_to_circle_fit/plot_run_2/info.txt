    Running with omega = 1 and g = 1. When running for plot in lambda, three
    values of t are used. The values of t are the prefix to all the different
    saved files. Vice versa when running for plot in t. The strategy for
    oscillator size is 40 up to lambda = 1, 100 up to lambda = 2, and 200
    above. Tolerance for the minimization in qmodel/dft.py is 1e-6.
