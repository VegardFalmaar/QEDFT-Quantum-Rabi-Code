    Running with omega = 1 and g = 1. When running for plot in lambda, three
    values of t are used. The values of t are the prefix to all the different
    saved files. Vice versa when running for plot in t. The strategy for
    oscillator size is 40 up to lambda = 1, 100 up to lambda = 2, and 200
    above. Tolerance for the minimization in qmodel/dft.py is 1e-6.


    For lmbda = 1.0, max std dev was
	for a: 4.51e-03
	for b: 1.33e-02

	Elapsed time: 4655.2 s

For lmbda = 2.0, max std dev was
	for a: 3.61e-03
	for b: 3.38e-02

	Elapsed time: 30141.5 s

For lmbda = 2.5, max std dev was
	for a: 3.77e-03
	for b: 4.72e-02

	Elapsed time: 67451.6 s
