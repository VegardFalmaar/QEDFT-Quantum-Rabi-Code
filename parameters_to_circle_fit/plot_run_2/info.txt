    Running with omega = 1 and g = 1. When running for plot in lambda, three
    values of t are used. The values of t are the prefix to all the different
    saved files. Vice versa when running for plot in t. The strategy for
    oscillator size is 40 up to lambda = 1, 100 up to lambda = 2, and 200
    above. Tolerance for the minimization in qmodel/dft.py is 1e-6.


    For t = 0.7, max std dev was
	for a: 2.22e-03
	for b: 1.79e-03
	Elapsed time: 18366.2 s

For t = 1.0, max std dev was
	for a: 3.16e-03
	for b: 4.15e-03
	Elapsed time: 35391.1 s

For t = 2.0, max std dev was
	for a: 5.64e-03
	for b: 2.04e-02
	Elapsed time: 49913.1 s
